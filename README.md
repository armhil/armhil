### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

If you are a recruiter, looking for an engineer with lots of open source experience; and somehow you've landed here, I'm sorry to disappoint you. You won't find much code here, except a few side projects that I've delivered over the years and I'm working at a veerrryy slow pace in polishing them and making them open-source. 

My full time job is dedicated to leading/managing people at the moment.

If however you've landed here by following some magic internet rabbit (who knows right!) - or you've stumbled upon something I've shipped and it's been broken/or working great - here are some things that you're likely to find here:

* I'm the proud owner of [Easy Code Formatter](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/office/WA104382008?tab=overview) - packages that support the core app are being made open source, stretched over time. This project is codifying tens of thousands of code snippets every month. For now, you can log issues to the styles repository. 
* You'll probably see sometime around 2023, a QR code addin - being made open-source. Simple tech, but shows the world I can build add-ins just fine ðŸ¤“
* Again - a Chromium extension that I've worked on, not the Protractor Test Generator, but a network interceptor is on it's way to being made public. 

So - those are the dev news. If you're here for figuring out what kind of a person am I regarding managing; I'm a big believer in books.

Here's a few recommendations, and LinkedIn at the bottom.

* [Managing People by Simon Birkenhead](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56587416-managing-people)
* [For New Managers by HBR](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31945262-hbr-s-10-must-reads-for-new-managers)
* [Manager's Path by Camille Fournier](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33369254-the-manager-s-path)
* [Radical Candor by Kim Malone Scott](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29939161-radical-candor?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=f62LKxA9DG&rank=1)

I've quite a few more, but in the interest of keeping this short, here's my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/armhil/).
